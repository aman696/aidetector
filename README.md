# AI Image Detector

## Project Overview
This project targets building a rule-based AI image detection system that identifies whether images are AI-generated or real using frequency domain analysis, eigenvalue decomposition, and metadata forensics.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Environment Setup**:
    Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
    Creates a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Project Structure**:
    - `src/`: Source code for detectors and classifier.
    - `data/`: Directory for storing real and AI-generated datasets.
    - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiments.
    - `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.

## Research Foundation
